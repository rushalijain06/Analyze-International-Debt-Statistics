# Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics

A project from Datacamp to do the analysis in SQL to answer some interesting questions about international debt using data from The World Bank such as:

- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
