-- 1. The World Bank's international debt data

-- The first line of code connects us to the international_debt database where the table international_debt is residing. Let's first SELECT all of the columns from the 
-- international_debt table. Also, we'll limit the output to the first ten rows to keep the output clean.

SELECT * 
  FROM international_debt 
  LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Finding the number of distinct countries

-- From the first ten rows, we can see the amount of debt owed by *Afghanistan* in the different debt indicators. But we do not know the number of different countries 
-- we have on the table. There are repetitions in the country names because a country is most likely to have debt in more than one debt indicator.
-- Without a count of unique countries, we will not be able to perform our statistical analyses holistically. In this section, we are going to extract the number of 
-- unique countries present in the table.

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS total_distinct_countries
    FROM international_debt;
    
-- 3. Finding out the distinct debt indicators

-- We can see there are a total of 124 countries present on the table. As we saw in the first section, there is a column called `indicator_name` that briefly specifies 
-- the purpose of taking the debt. Just beside that column, there is another column called `indicator_code` which symbolizes the category of these debts. Knowing about 
-- these various debt indicators will help us to understand the areas in which a country can possibly be indebted to.

SELECT 
  DISTINCT indicator_code AS distinct_debt_indicators
  FROM international_debt
  ORDER BY distinct_debt_indicators;

-- 4. Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries

-- As mentioned earlier, the financial debt of a particular country represents its economic state. But if we were to project this on an overall global scale, how will 
-- we approach it?
-- Let's switch gears from the debt indicators now and find out the total amount of debt (in USD) that is owed by the different countries. This will give us a sense of 
-- how the overall economy of the entire world is holding up.

SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(debt)/1000000, 2) AS total_debt
    FROM international_debt;
    
-- 5. Country with the highest debt

-- "Human beings cannot comprehend very large or very small numbers. It would be useful for us to acknowledge that fact." - [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman). 
-- That is more than *3 million **million*** USD, an amount which is really hard for us to fathom.
-- Now that we have the exact total of the amounts of debt owed by several countries, let's now find out the country that owns the highest amount of debt along with 
-- the amount. **Note** that this debt is the sum of different debts owed by a country across several categories. This will help to understand more about the country 
-- in terms of its socio-economic scenarios. We can also find out the category in which the country owns its highest debt. But we will leave that for now.

SELECT 
    country_name, SUM(debt) AS total_debt
    FROM international_debt
    GROUP BY country_name
    ORDER BY total_debt DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    
-- 6. Average amount of debt across indicators

-- So, it was *China*. A more in-depth breakdown of China's debts can be found [here](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/debt/ids/country/CHN).
-- We now have a brief overview of the dataset and a few of its summary statistics. We already have an idea of the different debt indicators in which the countries 
-- owe their debts. We can dig even further to find out on an average how much debt a country owes? This will give us a better sense of the distribution of the amount
-- of debt across different indicators.
